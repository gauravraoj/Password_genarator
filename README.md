# Password_generator
This project is a website that helps you create strong passwords. It uses three main technologies: HTML for the structure of the page, CSS for the design and layout, and JavaScript for making the password generation interactive.

On the website, you can:
- Choose the length of your password using a slider.
- Select if you want uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols in your password by checking boxes.
- See the strength of your password displayed visually.
- Generate a password by clicking a button.
- Copy the generated password to your clipboard with another button.

It's a helpful tool to create secure passwords easily.
